When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Using a remote repo would would be convenient if I worked from multiple computers, or 
if I was contributing to a project alongside someone else.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If Git were to sync code at regular intervals, it is likely that some of those saves would not run or compile. So manual pulls are more effective.

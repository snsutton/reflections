What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you
need to do it?

A .git directory is created. It contains all of the repository metadeta which holds the history and commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area allows you to track a smaller portion of
the files that you're editing, rather than the entirety
of the directory or repository.

What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you
need to do it?

A .git directory is created. It contains all of the repository metadeta which holds the history and commits.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area allows you to track a smaller portion of
the files that you're editing, rather than the entirety
of the directory or repository.


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

By comparing the staging area to the working directory and repo using git diff, you're able to
see all the new changes and manipulate which ones are committed.


What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

Branches help to organize experimental changes or more than 1 working production version.


How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

Diagrams are good at explaining reachability and visualizing checkouts.
